## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Rakesh689558/TaskManagementAssignment.git](https://github.com/Rakesh689558/TaskManagementAssignment.git)
    cd TaskManagementAssignment
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate into the frontend directory if it's separate, otherwise, you can skip this step.
    # cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate into the backend directory if it's separate.
    # cd backend
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    - Add your database connection string and other secrets (e.g., for JWT authentication).
    ```env
    # Example .env file
    MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    # From the backend directory
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend application:**
    ```bash
    # From the frontend directory
    npm start
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
